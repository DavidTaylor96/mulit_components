### Brief

Your task is to create an app that shows info for all the characters of the TV show Rick and Morty using multiple components. Use the Rick and Morty API to make a request to get the data.

### MVP

Display a list of character names.
Add a click event to the list item which should then render more detail about that character (name, species, status).
Use reusable components and event bus.

### Extensions

Instead of rendering a list, populate a dropdown with all of the characters names.
Add a change event to the select that renders information about the selected character.
